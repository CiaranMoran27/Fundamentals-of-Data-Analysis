    "## What is it?\n",
    "Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python programming language [5].<br>\n",
    "The library utilises a tree-like hierarchy structure to store its objects for each plot [3]. Matplotlib is a free open-sourced library<br>\n",
    "which is continually improving. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Brief History\n",
    "Matplotlib development started in the early 2000’s by John D. Hunter, a neurobiologist that emulated MATLAB’s capabilities to help<br> \n",
    "visualize electronic signals in the brain of epilepsy patients [1].Despite MATLAB’s limitations, it’s approach to plotting was retained<br>\n",
    "in the pyplot sub module which was developed to interface with Matplotlib through a collection of functions [5]. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Pyplot\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This sub module is typically imported from the Matplotlib library under the “plt”alias name and can carry out the majority of Matplotlib’s<br> \n",
    "plotting capabilities with relatively intuitive syntax.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting via pyplot is considered the stateful approach to plotting with Matplotlib, where calls are made via plt.plot() and other top level<br>\n",
    "pyplot functions which preserve states to keep track of the current figure and axes [3]. As described in *Python Plotting With Matplotlib <br>\n",
    "(Guide) 2021*, the simplicity of pyplot’s plotting syntax can be attributed to its wrapper functions that essentially call Matplotlib’s more<br> \n",
    "complicated object orientated interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plotting\n",
    "Functions can be found here: [pyplot functions](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/pyplot_summary.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The pyplot library can do many different plots via different functions calls. The arguments accepted by the different pytplot plots are<br>\n",
    "relatively similar, but for simplicity a worked example of a line plot will be explored."
